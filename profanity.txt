I can work under pressure and still be productive in a timely fashion. The ability to synchronously carry out tasks successfully is a capacity I have built over the years.
I have led a team of 152 employees in previous careers and turned non-promising circumstances to flourishing and enviable environments. Teamwork is a resource I put premium value on because every team member is important for the success of the establishment. 
I also believe in healthy camaraderie as a lubricant for team work with a fine blend of hard work and commitment. 
I have also worked in international capacities collaborating with persons of different nationalities and languages a shit which takes deep emotional intelligence to build.
